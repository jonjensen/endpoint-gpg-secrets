# endpoint-gpg-secrets

This is End Point's command-line tool for encrypting secrets files to a configured group of recipients using GnuPG so that our staff can safely share encrypted secrets, typically in a Git repository.

We normally use this with plain-text files, but we have also used it with KeePass .kdbx databases.

There are other ways to share secrets with a particular audience that are likely better for most people outside of End Point, but we share this for those who would like to use it.
